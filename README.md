# ðŸ”§ HDL Utilities: Randomized Testbenches & Scalable Modules

This repository is a growing collection of **reusable testbenches**, **scalable modules**, and **HDL design tools** written in **VHDL** and **Verilog**.

---

## âœ… Included So Far

- ðŸ”¹ A **randomized testbench in VHDL** for verifying adder designs (compatible with VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog)
- ðŸ”¹ A **scalable adder module** in both VHDL and Verilog
- ðŸ”¹ Support for **any bit width**
- ðŸ”¹ Clear inline comments and a testbench guide to help others plug in their own modules

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project was created to help students and HDL learners **validate their designs more effectively**. Many start with an adder â€” but often skip verification. My goal is to share **simple but powerful tools** to help bridge that gap.

As I have time, Iâ€™ll continue adding:
- ðŸ§ª More randomized testbenches
- ðŸ“¦ Scalable and modular components
- ðŸ§  Educational examples and wrappers
